Description: The package was written to perform classical GWAS for one-dimensional trait. It contains
             some functions written using `RcppArmadillo` for faster implementation of multiple hypothesis
             testing in GWAS. The functions are used in calculating restricted maximum likelihood estimates
             of the variance parameters as well as MLE of SNP effect size under a typical genetic Linear Mixed Model.
